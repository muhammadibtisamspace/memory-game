📦 Repository: https://github.com/muhammadibtisamspace/memory-game

A fun and interactive React-based Memory Game where players try to match pairs of cards by remembering their positions. This project showcases core React logic including card shuffling, match detection, and win conditions — built with React + Vite.

🚀 Features

🃏 Shuffling Logic – Randomizes card positions on every game start.

🔁 Match Detection – Tracks matched cards and keeps them revealed once matched.

🎉 Win Message – Shows a message when all pairs are matched.

⚛️ React Frontend – Built using modern React patterns with JSX.

⚡ Fast & Responsive – Powered by Vite for lightning-fast development and builds.

🧩 Gameplay

Click on a card to flip it.

Flip a second card — if it matches, it stays open.

If not, both cards flip back.

Continue until all pairs are matched.

Win the game and celebrate! 🎉
